So far, we have been using datasets that are already available within R. Chances are though that the
data you want to work with exists separately, perhaps as a spreadsheet or CSV file. In order to 
start working with this data, we need to learn how to read it in to R.

## Common file types 

There are many different ways that data could be stored, but for now we will focus on 
reading in tabular data. This is data that is already in a 
[data frame]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/06-Dataframes.md %})-like structure and so we will 
want to read it in to R as a data frame. 

Two of the most common ways you might find data like this are:

#### Plain text files

These are text files where the columns of data are separated by some delimiting character. Examples 
of these might include

* CSV (**c**omma **s**eparated **v**alue) files that use a comma to delimit the columns

~~~
carat,cut,color,clarity,depth,table,price,x,y,z
0.23,Ideal,E,SI2,61.5,55,326,3.95,3.98,2.43
0.21,Premium,E,SI1,59.8,61,326,3.89,3.84,2.31
0.23,Good,E,VS1,56.9,65,327,4.05,4.07,2.31
0.29,Premium,I,VS2,62.4,58,334,4.2,4.23,2.63
0.31,Good,J,SI2,63.3,58,335,4.34,4.35,2.75
~~~

* TSV (**t**ab **s**eparated **v**alue) files, which use a tab instead

~~~
carat	cut	color	clarity	depth	table	price	x	y	z
0.23	Ideal	E	SI2	61.5	55	326	3.95	3.98	2.43
0.21	Premium	E	SI1	59.8	61	326	3.89	3.84	2.31
0.23	Good	E	VS1	56.9	65	327	4.05	4.07	2.31
0.29	Premium	I	VS2	62.4	58	334	4.2	4.23	2.63
0.31	Good	J	SI2	63.3	58	335	4.34	4.35	2.75
~~~

#### Spreadsheet files

All spreadsheet programs (Excel, Calc, Numbers, etc.) will have a way to export data into one 
of the plain text formats above. This will usually be the best way to get data into R. For excel 
files (.xls or .xlsx) however, it is possible to read them in directly which we will demonstrate later
  
## Gapminder data {#gapminder}

For this section, we will be reading in data from the [Gapminder](www.gapminder.org) organisation, 
which records various statistics for 142 countries betwen 1952 and 2007. This
data is available as an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html),
but we have prepared [csv]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder.csv %}), 
[tsv]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder.tsv %}), and 
[excel]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder.xlsx %}) versions for you to practice with.

> ## Challenge 1
>
>  Download the three versions of the Gapminder above and save them to your project folder.
>  
>  Open one of the files and describe what statistics are recorded
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1

{: .challenge}

To load this data into R, we will use the `read_csv` function from the [`readr`](http://readr.tidyverse.org) package (which will 
be loaded automatically if you have preciously run `library(tidyverse)`, but here we will 
load it separately). 


~~~
library(readr)

gapminder_csv <- read_csv("data/gapminder.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  country = col_character(),
  continent = col_character(),
  year = col_double(),
  lifeExp = col_double(),
  pop = col_double(),
  gdpPercap = col_double()
)
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
gapminder_csv
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.

 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.

# … with 1,694 more rows

{: .output}

Here, we can see that `read_csv` provides us with some information on what it thinks the data types 
are as it reads the file in (two columns of character data and four columns of double in this case).
We can also see that it has imported the data in the 
[tibble format]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/06-Dataframes.md %}) discussed previously.

Similarly, for the tsv file there is a `read_tsv` function

## Control of import parameters

Both `read_csv` and `read_tsv` have a number of parameters that may be needed to help import a file.
You can read more about these in the help file for the functions, but some more commonly encountered
situations are:

#### Ignoring comments or metadata from the top of a file

Sometimes files will have metadata information included along with the data. Use `skip` to ignore a
set number of lines from the top of the file or `comment` if metadata lines are indicated by a 
specific character such as `#`.

Eg. a file such as:
~~~~
#Metadata information detailing data collection process
#Not part of the data, but included to explain it
country	continent	year	lifeExp	pop	gdpPercap
Afghanistan	Asia	1952	28.801	8425333	779.4453145
Afghanistan	Asia	1957	30.332	9240934	820.8530296
Afghanistan	Asia	1962	31.997	10267083	853.10071
~~~~

Can be read in using:

~~~~
read_tsv("data/commented_file.tsv", comment = "#")
read_tsv("data/commented_file.tsv", skip = 2)
~~~~
{: .language-r}

Both lines above produce the same output

#### Providing column names

By default, `readr` assumes that the first row of data is a "header" - that is defines the names of the columnes for the data frame. If this is not
the case you can either specify the names manually with a character vector, or have the column names generated 
automatically

Eg. 
~~~~
Afghanistan	Asia	1952	28.801	8425333	779.4453145
Afghanistan	Asia	1957	30.332	9240934	820.8530296
Afghanistan	Asia	1962	31.997	10267083	853.10071
~~~~

Can be read in using:

~~~~
read_tsv("data/no_names.tsv", col_names = F)
~~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 6
   X1          X2       X3    X4       X5    X6
   <chr>       <chr> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan Asia   1952  28.8  8425333  779.
 2 Afghanistan Asia   1957  30.3  9240934  821.
 3 Afghanistan Asia   1962  32.0 10267083  853.
~~~~
{:  .output}

or

~~~~
read_tsv("data/no_names.tsv", col_names = c("country", "continent","year","lifeExp","pop","gdpPercap"))
~~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
~~~~
{:  .output}

#### Dealing with missing data

By default, blank columns or ones containing "NA" are considered missing. If your data uses a different
value for missing data you will need to specify it.

Eg. 
~~~~
country	continent	year	lifeExp	pop	gdpPercap
Afghanistan	Asia	1952	28.801	8425333	779.4453145
Afghanistan	Asia	1957	30.332	-	820.8530296
Afghanistan	Asia	1962	31.997	10267083	853.10071
~~~~

~~~~
read_tsv("data/missing.tsv")
~~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp pop      gdpPercap
  <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>        <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8 8425333       779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3 -             821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
~~~~
{: .output}

Using the default parameters, `pop` is incorrectly read in as a character column because 
missing data is indicated by `-`

~~~~
read_tsv("data/missing.tsv", na = "-")
~~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3       NA      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
~~~~

Now the `pop` data is correctly recognised as a number, and the missing data is correctly recorded
as `NA`.

#### Setting explicit column types

Sometimes, the default column types might not be what you intend. In that case you can set them 
explicitly by either providing a string representing the column types

> From the `read_tsv` help file:
> c = character, i = integer, n = number, d = double, l = logical, f = factor, D = date, 
> T = date time, t = time, ? = guess, or _/- to skip the column
{: .quotation}

Eg. setting `country` to be a factor, `pop` as an integer, and not reading in the `lifeExp` column.
The remaining columns are left as 'guess', in which case `readr` tries to determine their type automatically.

~~~
read_tsv("data/gapminder.tsv", col_types = "f??-i?")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

{: .callout}

Or by providing a column specification, like how `read_csv` did to explain it's default parsing 
when we [first ran it](#gapminder)

Importing the same types as above in this format would look like this:

~~~
# Default is col_guess()
# So we just need to specify the 
# columns that are different 
gapminder_spec <- cols(
  country = col_factor(), 
  pop = col_integer(), 
  gdpPercap = col_skip()
)

read_tsv("data/gapminder.tsv", col_types = gapminder_spec)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1,704 x 5
   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop

10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415

Knowing how these few parameters work will enable you to read most csv/tsv files you come across into R.

## Reading excel files

For reading in excel files, we will use the [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) package. This 
package is part of the tidyverse, but is not loaded with `library(tidyverse)`, so we will have to do
it ourselves.


~~~
library(readxl)
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can now use the `read_excel` function from `readxl` to read in our data.


~~~
gapminder_excel <- read_excel("data/gapminder.xlsx")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Since `read_excel` uses most of the same options as `read_csv`/`read_tsv` covered above, you already
know how to use it. Some excel specific options you may need to use include

#### Specifying the worksheet to extract

The gapminder data is all in the first sheet in the file (called 'gapminder'). This means that 

~~~~
read_excel("data/gapminder.xlsx")
read_excel("data/gapminder.xlsx", sheet = 1)
read_excel("data/gapminder.xlsx", sheet = "gapminder")
~~~~
{: .language-r}

will all produce the same result.

#### Extracting data from a specific range

Perhaps you are only interested in data from a particular region of the worksheet. This can be
imported using an excel range pattern.


~~~
read_excel("data/gapminder.xlsx", range = "A1:E4")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 5
