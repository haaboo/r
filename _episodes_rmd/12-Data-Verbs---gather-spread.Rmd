```

Having had some exposure to working with tidyverse functions, you might now understand
why it is beneficial to work with [tidy data]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/04-Tidy-Data.md %}).
These data manipulation functions are all designed to work easily with tidy data, leaving you with
more time to actually try to answer questions with the data.

Unfortunately, real data sets can come in all shapes and sizes and may not be structured for you to
efficiently analyse it. To help tidy our data up in preparation for analysis, we will turn to the 
`tidyr` package from the tidyverse.

## Tidy data review
Before getting into a real example, we'll have a look at a toy dataset. The following dataframe has 
two weight measurements for three different cows. Have a look at the way the data is structured. 
Is it tidy?

```{r show-cows, message=F, warning=F}
cows <- data_frame(id = c(1, 2, 3),
                   weight1 = c(203, 227, 193),
                   weight2 = c(365, 344, 329))
cows
```
What might make this dataset tidy?

## Table massaging with `gather()` and `spread()`

To make this dataframe tidy, we may need to have only one weight variable, and another variable 
describing whether it is measurement 1 or 2. The `gather()` function from `tidyr` can do this 
conversion for us. You can think of `gather()` as scooping all the data up into one big tall pile.

```{r gather-intro}
cows_long <- cows %>% 
  gather(measurement, weight, weight1, weight2)

cows_long
```

`gather()` works by converting the data into a set of key-value pairs, in which the 
*key* describes what the data is, and the *value* records the actual data. For example, `weight1`-`203`
is the key-value pair for the first row of the gathered table.

The call to `gather()` therefore works in two parts. First we specify the names of the new key-value pair 
columns (`measurement` and `weight` in this case). Then we tell it which columns should be gathered
(`weight1` and `weight2` here). `gather()` then takes the contents of those columns and places them 
into the new *value* column, and labels them with their column name as the *key*.

This transformation may be easier to see in action, so let's have a look at the way `gather()` has 
worked on the original data.

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/15-tidyr-gather.gif %})

As well as going from wide to long, we can go back the other way. Instead of `gather()`, we need to 
`spread()` the data.

```{r spread-intro}
cows_long %>% 
  spread(measurement, weight)
```

This works in reverse, taking the names of out key-value columns and spreading them out. Each unique
value in the key column is given a separate column of it's own. And the content of that column is 
taken from the specified value column.

## Realistic data

Until now, we've been using the original gapminder dataset which comes pre-tidied, but
'real' data (i.e. our own research data) will never be so well organised. Here
let's start with the wide format version of the gapminder dataset.

> Download the wide version of the gapminder data from [here]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder_wide.csv %}) and save it in your project's `data` directory.

Read in the wide gapminder and have a look at it.

```{r read-wide, message = F}
gap_wide <- read_csv("data/gapminder_wide.csv")

gap_wide
```

You can see that wide format has many more columns than our original gapminder data because each 
metric has a separate column for each year of measurement. 

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/15-tidyr-fig2.png %})

## From wide to long

The first step towards recreating the nice and tidy gapminder format is to
convert this data from a wide to a long format. The `tidyr` function `gather()` will
'gather' your observation variables into a single variable.

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/15-tidyr-fig3.png %})

```{r gather-gapminder}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
    gather(obstype_year, obs_values, starts_with('pop'),
           starts_with('lifeExp'), starts_with('gdpPercap'))
gap_long
```

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/15-tidyr-fig4.png %})

Inside `gather()` we first name the new column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`), the name 
for the new amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`), then the names of the old observation 
variable. We could have typed out all the observation variables, but since `gather()` can use all the same
[helper functions]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/06-Data-Verbs---select.md %}#select-helper-functions)
as the `select()` function can, we can use the `starts_with()` argument to select all variables
that starts with the desired character string. Gather also allows the alternative
syntax of using the `-` symbol to identify which variables are not to be
gathered (i.e. ID variables) so that 
~~~~
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(obstype_year, obs_values, -continent, -country)
~~~~
{: .language-r}

is an alternative way of specifying the columns to gather in the wide data set. The best method for 
any particular data set will depend on how many columns you need to gather and how they are named.

## Separating column data

Now, the `obstype_year` column actually contains two pieces of information, the observation
type (`pop`,`lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`. We can use the `separate()` function to split
the character strings into multiple variables. 

```{r separate-intro}
gap_separated <- gap_long %>% 
  separate(obstype_year, into = c('obs_type', 'year'), sep = "_")

gap_separated
```

You provide `separate()` with a column name containing the values to split, the names of the columns
you would like to separate them into, and where to split the values (by default it splits on any non
alphanumeric character).

{: .challenge}

The opposite to `separate()` is `unite()`. Use this when you are wanting to *combine* columns into 
one long string. You provide `unite()` with the name to give the newly combined column, and the 
names of the columns to combine.

```{r unite-intro}
gap_separated %>% 
  unite(obstype_year, obs_type, year)
```

## From long to tidy

The final step in recreating the gapminder data structure is to spread our observation variables out
from the long format we have created.

> ## Challenge 2
> Spread the `gap_separated` data above to create a new data frame that has the same dimensions as the 
> original `gapminder` data.
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> > ``` {r tidyr-sol-2}
> > gap_orig <- gap_separated %>% 
> >   spread(obs_type, obs_values)
> > 
> > gap_orig
> > 
> > dim(gap_orig)
> > dim(gapminder)
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We're almost there, the original was sorted by `country`, `continent`, then `year`. So finish 
everything off with an `arrange()` and then a `select()` to get the columns in the right order.

```{r tidyr-finish-up}
gap_orig <- gap_orig %>% 
  arrange(country, continent, year) %>% 
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

gap_orig

gapminder
```

Great work! We've taken a messy data set and tidied it into a form that works well with all the 
tidyverse functions you have been using up until now.
